# Test Frameworks

Currently, this is a work-in-progress. The goal is to identify a test framework suitable to replace `autotest`.

## Test Frameworks Candidates

Below is the list of test frameworks candidates:

- [Avocado] - Avocado is a next generation testing framework inspired by `autotest` and modern development tools such as `git`.
- [Criterion] - A dead-simple, yet extensible, C and C++ unit testing framework.
- [Catch2] - Catch2 is a multi-paradigm test framework for C++.
- [bandit] - Bandit is a framework for C++11 that wants to make working with unit tests a pleasant experience.
- [UNITY] - Unit testing for C (especially embedded software).

## Comparison Table

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.
