# Test Frameworks

Currently, this is a work-in-progress. The goal is to identify a test framework suitable to replace `autotest`.

## Test Frameworks Candidates

Below is the list of test frameworks candidates:

- [Avocado] - Avocado is a next generation testing framework inspired by `autotest` and modern development tools such as `git`.
- [Boost.Test] - The Boost.Test library provides both an easy to use and flexible set of interfaces for writing test programs, organizing tests into simple test cases and test suites, and controlling their runtime execution.
- [Criterion] - A dead-simple, yet extensible, C and C++ unit testing framework.
- [Catch2] - Catch2 is a multi-paradigm test framework for C++.
- [bandit] - Bandit is a framework for C++11 that wants to make working with unit tests a pleasant experience.
- [UNITY] - Unit testing for C (especially embedded software).
